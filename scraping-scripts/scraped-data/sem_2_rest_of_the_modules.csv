5,HL3003,FILM & LITERATURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001 OR FL8001 (Min Grade :B),,"This course is about more than just literature adaptations. In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature. This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature. You will learn to analyze film adaptations and assess their impact on the reception of the source texts.

It will include hands-on examination of books and manuscript fragments as well as discussion of books as objects, social forces, and vehicles for text."
7,HL3044,THE LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"Who was King Arthur, and how did he evolve into the household name that he is today? Where did the legends of his knights originate, and how did they develop over time? How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'."

The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course."

It explores the changing focus and meaning in the literary or cinematic rendering of different locales. While a place can be the anchor of identity, site of cultural memory and practice, and refuge for dwelling, such meanings are not given but very much the work of cultural imagination and creation. How do literature and cinema contribute to creating a sense of place and confer an identity on a place, under what circumstances and to what political and cultural effects? As the deepening environmental crises increasingly ravages our natural world, how do the writings on places document environmental degradation? How do their otherworldly portrayals - be them industrial, postindustrial, heterotopic, dystopic, etc. - shed light on our collective reality and engage our senses and intellect to promote possible social change? These are the important questions we will discuss in this course."

It also introduces film analysis from an ecocritical angle, using a series of films as case studies in ecocriticism and its cognate fields. The course will explore the agenda and rhetorical strategies of more obviously environmentalist filmmaking, as well as examining fiction films that reflect environmentalist concerns in more abstract or allegorical ways. It will thus equip students interested in environmental politics and cinema to recognize and interrogate the assumptions that link popular culture to environmental history and discourse."

We'll take an eco-critical perspective and develop an analytical toolkit that we'll apply to various discourses, including those referred to as `environmentalist'. We will analyze a wide range of texts (pieces of journalistic, academic and policy writing, excerpts from textbooks, advertisements, mission statements and `about us' sections of various companies and corporations, examples of `green initiatives' and environmentalist campaigning, blogs, literary narratives and poetry), and unpack the main tropes, frames and strategies through which environmentally hazardous discourses become normalized. We will also look for the alternatives that promote ecological harmony. Our major topics include but are not limited to: development, growth, progress, climate change, animal rights, nature-as-resource, individualism, consumerism, culturally constructed images of the ideal body and food consumption.

While the majority of texts will be drawn from the ""classic,"" or canonical, works of English Literature, we shall also critically question the rationale of a canon-formation that focuses specifically on British writers. We shall trace European influences and debate the impact of popular culture on literary developments. In thus offering the study of a number of canonical and non-canonical texts, we will stress specifically the revolution in poetry achieved by the Romantics, the rise of the novel as a new genre, the experimental nature of nineteenth and twentieth-century literature, the impact of modernism and postmodernism, and the ways these developments have defined our understanding of literature and culture."

Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic ""Age of Faith"" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages. Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required."
160,HL2005,VICTORIAN LITERATURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"Victorian Literature introduces a selection of literary works from the nineteenth century, while drawing attention to neglected aspects of this extremely versatile, fast changing, and intriguingly self-conscious age. The course aims to foster excitement about the indeterminacies, doubts, and fissures that shaped the Victorian period's greatest cultural achievements. At the same time, we shall critically reconsider the many legacies of the shifts it saw in epistemological, cultural, and specifically literary conceptualisations. This module provides an overview of the most important works, themes, and concerns of the Victorian age, one of the most prolific periods of English literature. You will learn how to analyze, discuss, and write criticism about canonical texts and the popular culture of the time. You will also be encouraged to evaluate critically your attitudes and responses to ""the Victorians""."
161,HL2006,MODERNISM,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer."

The contemporary is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes and contemporary authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery. Many contemporary authors engage with the relativisation of various kinds of values and we will closely consider the ways in which this tendency continually resurfaces."
163,HL2021,LITERATURE OF EMPIRE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"In this module we will be focusing on literature produced in response to the historical experience of Empire. We will look at the way in which literary narratives have been used to legitimize the imperial project - justifying its `civilizing mission', reinforcing certain racial stereotypes and hierarchies, and contributing to an archive of knowledge on colonial subjects and territories. However this complicity between literature and Empire is only part of the story. We will also be exploring the ambivalence that so often haunts the peripheries of imperial narratives, and examining the way in which literature has served to critique colonial ideologies and practices. Our discussion will be wide-ranging, both historically and geographically. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will also include analyses of Herge's"

In exploring this expanding terrain, we will encounter new genres and media, consider the impact of race and gender on ideas of freedom and democracy, and assess the formation of an American canon. Our goal is a critical familiarity with texts that have claimed a place in American literary history and the social movements that produced them."
165,HL2029,AMERICAN MODERNISM,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This course analyzes and interprets American culture mostly from the first half of the twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, and film, looking at the way that the conditions of modernity engendered new forms that go beyond the earlier novel/romance dichotomy. We'll study realism (Cather); naturalism in its classic, modernist, and Depression-era forms (London, Stein, Steinbeck, respectively); as well as classic modernists Eliot, Hemingway, and West, examining their experiments involving perspective, language, history, memory, and the surreal. We'll study the dark filmic vision of film noir, focusing on patterns of corrupt morality, cold passion, and dehumanizing modernity. The short fiction of the Southern Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor will be discussed in terms of the grotesque and the cultural division of country and city. We'll read Naked Lunch, Burroughs' shockingly experimental work examining power and addiction. We'll conclude with a novel by Robinson that evokes a hybrid world of nature and domesticity through non-hierarchical, non-individualized discourse."
166,HL2030,POST 1945 AMERICAN LITERATURE & CULTURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001(Corequisite),,"Through the interpretation and study of selected works of American literature and culture from 1945 to the present, we will consider the ways that writers respond to changes in the economic, political, and social conditions of the United States during the postmodern era. While some writers reassert long-standing themes such as the individual's quest for freedom defined against the constrictions of status-quo, domestic life (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Morrison, the Confessional Poets), others pose intellectual questions about language and meaning through metafictional innovation (Nabokov, Vonnegut, Barth) or confront national myths such as the American Dream (Dylan, Mamet) and the romance of the Western frontier (McCarthy). In an age where mass culture has replaced intellectual literacy, contemporary American authors ponder the place of the novelist in the world (DeLillo), reflect on the meaning of ethnic identity (Walker), and seek out a critical perspective from which to view the present"

It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies."

It also has a special relationship with Anglophone literature and culture, having had an outsized influence on it from the Victorian era to the present day, and proving to be powerful inspiration for such varied authors such as Walter Scott, William Morris, J. R. R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden and Seamus Heaney, as well as the entire genre of fantasy literature, and, to a lesser extent, historical fiction. Today its influence stretches to other media forms beyond the written word, from music to film to television to video games. This module will provide an introductory overview to the language and literature of medieval Iceland. Each class would contain both literary and linguistic components. The linguistic training is designed to cultivate a basic linguistic proficiency to enable original-language engagement with the literary works. The literary material and discussions will cover not only issues of style, genre and historical context, but also interconnected philological questions such as textual preservation and transmission, transcultural intertextuality (i.e. the influence of works from other European literary cultures), and the relationship between vernacular and liturgical language. In offering a broad introduction to this influential medieval literary culture, the module will also serve as a useful foundation for students interested in questions of medievalism in Victorian literature, historical fiction and fantasy literature, amongst other subjects."
169,HL3003,FILM & LITERATURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001 OR FL8001 (Min Grade :B),,"This course is about more than just literature adaptations. In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature. This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature. You will learn to analyze film adaptations and assess their impact on the reception of the source texts. It develops your skills in close reading, trains you in the theory and practice of adaptation, and enhances your knowledge and understanding of genre. Please refer to the planned weekly schedule for a specific list of topics."

Among other matters, existential issues raised by urbanisation and industrial development will be addressed. The search for an idiom and imagery appropriate to a Southeast Asian locale, the challenge posed by primordialism, the issue of alternative modernities and the need to fashion a usable past from disparate material are other topics handled by the course. Students will be encouraged to formulate a first-cut analysis of where they place themselves with regards to these questions and concerns."

You will examine examples of books from different periods, both to understand how book production changed over time and to explore broader questions about the nature of texts, their reception, and their associated communities and contexts. By learning how books were made and used, you will gain a clearer appreciation of how culture was shaped by the development of books, and how it shaped the development of books in turn. The archival and research skills you learn during this course will serve you in future research projects. This course explores the influence of the book as a force in history and literature from the medieval period to the present. It will include hands-on examination of books and manuscript fragments as well as discussion of books as objects, social forces, and vehicles for text."

Where did the legends of his knights originate, and how did they develop over time? How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'."

You will examine poetry from a variety of genres (pastorals, georgics, elegies, sonnets, free-verse) alongside work in other fields, including anthropology, environmental studies, and sociology. In doing so, you will not only consider the experiences of precarity and the structures that enable it from a variety of cultural perspectives, but also experiment with understanding contemporary experiences of precarity from a historical point-of-view."

According to Jean Francois Lyotard, scientific knowledge has traditionally been legitimated for being either emancipatory, or according to how it assists in the realization of a unified scientific whole. Texts by Ibsen and Glaspell provide an opportunity for investigating the poignancy of the first of these legitimation narratives, while texts by Ursula LeGuin and John Banville will help us evaluate the second legitimation narrative. Finally, we will conclude the semester by questioning whether scientific knowledge is, as Foucault suggests, ?linked in a circular relation with systems of power which produce and sustain it, and to effects of power which it induces and which extend it. A regime of truth; - relevant texts to this discussion are Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 and Darren Aronofsky's Pi."

How is the threat of child mortality treated in the New-England Primer's rhyming alphabet (1727) and Christina Rossetti's verse parable Goblin Market (1862)? How do Isaac Watts and George MacDonald respond differently to the challenge of introducing young readers to Christian theology? What taxonomic comparisons might we locate between John Newbery's eighteenth-century compendiums and Victorian children's magazine? This course will also develop students' skills in using archival databases such as Eighteenth-Centurey Collections Online and Nineteenth-Century Collections Online."

As a concept, we trace the theoretical understanding of the human from humanism, transhumanism to posthumanism. As a lived reality, we consider our place in the shifting relations between the human, the nonhuman and our environments. By close reading selected films, literary works and critical writings, we will explore encounters between the humanities and the sciences to rethink our relationship with our immediate reality. Our central question is: What does it mean to be human in the face of rapid technological advances, digitalization, climate change and the destruction of biodiversity?"

In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature. This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature.

We shall be discussing what Development means by examining different development pathways and strategies throughout the global economy. While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems."

Issues that involve the biological occur in many different locations with different styles of governance, but analyses of biopolitics have tended to relate more to European history. Within the grain of Asian history, the study of issues that involve the biological requires a questioning of existing theoretical frameworks used to examine the politicization of life.

We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity. For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning. We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs."

274,HH3045,COLD WAR IN ASIA: TRANSNATIONAL & MICRO APPROACHES,3.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This module explores the history of the Cold War in Asia, using a micro and transnational approach. Before the 2000s, most historical research on the Cold War was either American-centric or Euro-centric. The non-Western world, in particular East Asia, a `fault-line region' (Major and Mitter), was under-studied. The history of the Cold War therefore was asymmetrical. The end of the Cold War and the subsequent opening of archives in former colonies enable the reconstruction of Cold War history in East and Southeast Asia in a broad historical context connecting them with China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia). Adopting a micro and transnational approach, this course uses Hong Kong, a `Cold War pivot' as a starting point to trace how ideas were disseminated transborder and how big powers' activities in the colony affected how the Cold War was unfolded in countries in East and Southeast Asia. Ever since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Hong Kong, a British colony, was a battleground for competing ideologies: communism and capitalism. Hong Kong was relatively liberal as a colony. Economically, the principle of `laissez-faire' was adopted by the colonial regime. Politically, despite the absence of democracy, the colonial government introduced the City District Officer Scheme to solicit public opinion. Socially, the state propagated the idea of freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion. As an alien administration that ruled over two million Chinese residents in the post-war period, the colonial government constantly faced a problem of legitimacy and was susceptible to Communist infiltration. The Chinese Communist Party participated in Hong Kong life and used its base in the territory to encourage the uptake of radical ideas throughout Asia. In addition, the United States Information Services and the Nationalists disseminated propaganda to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia using its representative and secret operatives in Hong Kong. Hong Kong also played important role during conflicts. For example, through Hong Kong, strategic goods were shipped to Korea during the Korean War despite the trade embargo. And it was also a shelter for Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War. In theory, under British liberal legal traditions, the administration sought to create a permissive environment for social movements to propagate ideas that were critical of colonialism and capitalism. In practice, the colonial state monitored radicalism closely and repressed it using all possible means. The approach adopted by the colonial government in handling these Cold War activities influenced how the Cold War was unfolded in Asia, in particular Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and Singapore. Through this course, not only comparisons can be drawn between Cold War activities in different territories and countries, students can also learn about the transnational network: how ideas, ruling strategies and technologies flowed and exchanged transnationally and people moved across the borders. Both high diplomacy and cultural activities will be explored. Students can identify similarities and differences in Cold War experiences between the East and the West, setting up a transnational comparative framework for further studies."
275,HH4007,INTERNATIONAL HISTORY OF THE COLD WAR,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HH1001 OR HH9101,,"This course is about the history of Southeast Asia and the Cold War. It aims to enlighten students on the origins and course of the conflict in the subregion in the global context. It also seeks to help students appreciate the cultural, diplomatic, economic, political, and social impacts of the twentieth century global conflict on Southeast Asia. In addition, the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history."

278,HH4029,"HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA & COLONIAL HONG KONG, C.1945-1997",4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HH1001,,"This module explores the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of British Hong Kong during the period from 1945 to 1997. It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony. Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired."

In addition to covering major political developments, we will pay close attention to religious, intellectual, and social trends, as well as to changes in the material culture of ancient China. Throughout the course we will focus particularly on recent archaeological discoveries. Nearly eighty years of scientific archaeology in China has produced a wide array of data that have revolutionized our understanding of ancient history. As new texts and artifacts continue to be unearthed, historians struggle to reconcile this new knowledge about the past with a received historical tradition that goes back 2000 years. This tension between received historical knowledge and modern archaeology puts archaeology at the heart of fierce historiographic debates. This course will explore these issues by examining early Chinese history in light of major archaeological discoveries of texts and materials, discussing both the content of the discoveries and their impact on the historiography of ancient China."

As a research agenda, the sociolinguistics of globalization represents a relatively new, but rapidly growing and vibrant interdisciplinary approach to the place and role of language in the contemporary flows of people, capital, ideas, world views, cultural artefacts and representations. Change, mobility, and flux have come to characterize contemporary social life and social imagination, and this course will be a forum for you to engage with the relevant readings that deal with these issues from a sociolinguistic perspective. Throughout the course, we will be examining conditions and themes that have come to occupy a prominent place in the sociolinguistic research program. We will identify what new theoretical and methodological notions we need to add to our `traditional' sociolinguistic repertoire to be able to scrutinize communication and emergent regimes of language in the contexts of superdiversity, spatial and symbolic mobility, globalized economic markets, tourism, war and terrorism."

This also lays the groundwork for research using big data and machine learning of language."
316,HG4071,THE MEAT OF SPEECH,4.0,LMS(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HG2003,,"The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical terminology, but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the physiological principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last. The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques. The mechanism of the supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory speech synthesizers (such as VocaiTractlab; http://www.vocaltractlab.de/) will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such as voicing and aspiration, will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal articulation. Students will gain an appreciation of the complex orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce detailed descriptions of the physiological events involved such sequences, including those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression. The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to some of the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain. The students will be introduced briefly to the anatomy of the brain and the cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production and perception by describing (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound. The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible. Key subjects covered include: 1. using anatomical and physiological terminology to describe the processes of speech production and perception; 2. the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms of speech production; 3. an appreciation of the link (and sometimes lack thereof) between anatomical form and physiological function; 4. an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing; 5. practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation data."

According to Jean Francois Lyotard, scientific knowledge has traditionally been legitimated for being either emancipatory, or according to how it assists in the realization of a unified scientific whole. Texts by Ibsen and Glaspell provide an opportunity for investigating the poignancy of the first of these legitimation narratives, while texts by Ursula LeGuin and John Banville will help us evaluate the second legitimation narrative. Finally, we will conclude the semester by questioning whether scientific knowledge is, as Foucault suggests, ?linked in a circular relation with systems of power which produce and sustain it, and to effects of power which it induces and which extend it. A regime of truth; - relevant texts to this discussion are Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 and Darren Aronofsky's Pi."

Biomedical technologies, biosecurity, biodiversity, and biobanking number among various issues that increasingly pertain to biopolitics. Used to describe 17th century shifts in sovereign power, Foucault raised the term biopolitics, along with anatomo-politics, to describe how different levels of life became increasingly regulated, from species-centric populations to individual bodies, respectively. Issues that involve the biological occur in many different locations with different styles of governance, but analyses of biopolitics have tended to relate more to European history. Within the grain of Asian history, the study of issues that involve the biological requires a questioning of existing theoretical frameworks used to examine the politicization of life. This class explores imperial, colonial, and national experiences in East Asia in order to examine how various societies, polities, and people have authored, approached, and interpreted knowledge about different levels of regenerative life.

GC0001(Corequisite),"AB0001, AB0301, AB0401, AB0402, AB0501, AB0603","With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities. Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances."

603,BU5644,SMARTER BRAIN? THE SCIENCE OF DECISION MAKING,3.0,BUS,Yes,Letter Graded,,,"Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions."

GC0001(Corequisite),"AB0001, AB0301, AB0401, AB0402, AB0501, AB0603","With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general."

Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions."

Story depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles. Having instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

While the majority of texts will be drawn from the ""classic,"" or canonical, works of English Literature, we shall also critically question the rationale of a canon-formation that focuses specifically on British writers. We shall trace European influences and debate the impact of popular culture on literary developments. In thus offering the study of a number of canonical and non-canonical texts, we will stress specifically the revolution in poetry achieved by the Romantics, the rise of the novel as a new genre, the experimental nature of nineteenth and twentieth-century literature, the impact of modernism and postmodernism, and the ways these developments have defined our understanding of literature and culture."

Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic ""Age of Faith"" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages. Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required."

The course aims to foster excitement about the indeterminacies, doubts, and fissures that shaped the Victorian period's greatest cultural achievements. At the same time, we shall critically reconsider the many legacies of the shifts it saw in epistemological, cultural, and specifically literary conceptualisations. This module provides an overview of the most important works, themes, and concerns of the Victorian age, one of the most prolific periods of English literature. You will learn how to analyze, discuss, and write criticism about canonical texts and the popular culture of the time.

1066,HL2006,MODERNISM,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer."

The contemporary is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes and contemporary authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery. Many contemporary authors engage with the relativisation of various kinds of values and we will closely consider the ways in which this tendency continually resurfaces."

We will examine the centrality of war to human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to: the structural constitution of war the differences and similarities between war and violence the inherent ambivalence of war semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture Just War or just war? visual vs textual representations"
1069,HL2021,LITERATURE OF EMPIRE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"In this module we will be focusing on literature produced in response to the historical experience of Empire. We will look at the way in which literary narratives have been used to legitimize the imperial project - justifying its `civilizing mission', reinforcing certain racial stereotypes and hierarchies, and contributing to an archive of knowledge on colonial subjects and territories. However this complicity between literature and Empire is only part of the story. We will also be exploring the ambivalence that so often haunts the peripheries of imperial narratives, and examining the way in which literature has served to critique colonial ideologies and practices. Our discussion will be wide-ranging, both historically and geographically. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will also include analyses of Herge's"

1071,HL2029,AMERICAN MODERNISM,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This course analyzes and interprets American culture mostly from the first half of the twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, and film, looking at the way that the conditions of modernity engendered new forms that go beyond the earlier novel/romance dichotomy. We'll study realism (Cather); naturalism in its classic, modernist, and Depression-era forms (London, Stein, Steinbeck, respectively); as well as classic modernists Eliot, Hemingway, and West, examining their experiments involving perspective, language, history, memory, and the surreal. We'll study the dark filmic vision of film noir, focusing on patterns of corrupt morality, cold passion, and dehumanizing modernity. The short fiction of the Southern Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor will be discussed in terms of the grotesque and the cultural division of country and city. We'll read Naked Lunch, Burroughs' shockingly experimental work examining power and addiction. We'll conclude with a novel by Robinson that evokes a hybrid world of nature and domesticity through non-hierarchical, non-individualized discourse."
1072,HL2030,POST 1945 AMERICAN LITERATURE & CULTURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001(Corequisite),,"Through the interpretation and study of selected works of American literature and culture from 1945 to the present, we will consider the ways that writers respond to changes in the economic, political, and social conditions of the United States during the postmodern era. While some writers reassert long-standing themes such as the individual's quest for freedom defined against the constrictions of status-quo, domestic life (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Morrison, the Confessional Poets), others pose intellectual questions about language and meaning through metafictional innovation (Nabokov, Vonnegut, Barth) or confront national myths such as the American Dream (Dylan, Mamet) and the romance of the Western frontier (McCarthy). In an age where mass culture has replaced intellectual literacy, contemporary American authors ponder the place of the novelist in the world (DeLillo), reflect on the meaning of ethnic identity (Walker), and seek out a critical perspective from which to view the present"

It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies."
1074,HL2046,OLD NORSE LANGUAGE & LITERATURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"Old Norse-Icelandic literature-the literature of medieval Iceland- is one of the richest vernacular literatures of medieval Europe, spanning poetry and prose works covering a multitude of modes and genres: mythological; historiographical; religious; panegyric; legendary; fictional; realistic. It also has a special relationship with Anglophone literature and culture, having had an outsized influence on it from the Victorian era to the present day, and proving to be powerful inspiration for such varied authors such as Walter Scott, William Morris, J. R. R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden and Seamus Heaney, as well as the entire genre of fantasy literature, and, to a lesser extent, historical fiction. Today its influence stretches to other media forms beyond the written word, from music to film to television to video games. This module will provide an introductory overview to the language and literature of medieval Iceland. Each class would contain both literary and linguistic components. The linguistic training is designed to cultivate a basic linguistic proficiency to enable original-language engagement with the literary works. The literary material and discussions will cover not only issues of style, genre and historical context, but also interconnected philological questions such as textual preservation and transmission, transcultural intertextuality (i.e. the influence of works from other European literary cultures), and the relationship between vernacular and liturgical language. In offering a broad introduction to this influential medieval literary culture, the module will also serve as a useful foundation for students interested in questions of medievalism in Victorian literature, historical fiction and fantasy literature, amongst other subjects."

In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature. This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature. You will learn to analyze film adaptations and assess their impact on the reception of the source texts. It develops your skills in close reading, trains you in the theory and practice of adaptation, and enhances your knowledge and understanding of genre. Please refer to the planned weekly schedule for a specific list of topics."

Among other matters, existential issues raised by urbanisation and industrial development will be addressed. The search for an idiom and imagery appropriate to a Southeast Asian locale, the challenge posed by primordialism, the issue of alternative modernities and the need to fashion a usable past from disparate material are other topics handled by the course. Students will be encouraged to formulate a first-cut analysis of where they place themselves with regards to these questions and concerns."

You will examine examples of books from different periods, both to understand how book production changed over time and to explore broader questions about the nature of texts, their reception, and their associated communities and contexts. By learning how books were made and used, you will gain a clearer appreciation of how culture was shaped by the development of books, and how it shaped the development of books in turn. The archival and research skills you learn during this course will serve you in future research projects. This course explores the influence of the book as a force in history and literature from the medieval period to the present. It will include hands-on examination of books and manuscript fragments as well as discussion of books as objects, social forces, and vehicles for text."

Where did the legends of his knights originate, and how did they develop over time? How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'."

According to Jean Francois Lyotard, scientific knowledge has traditionally been legitimated for being either emancipatory, or according to how it assists in the realization of a unified scientific whole. Texts by Ibsen and Glaspell provide an opportunity for investigating the poignancy of the first of these legitimation narratives, while texts by Ursula LeGuin and John Banville will help us evaluate the second legitimation narrative. Finally, we will conclude the semester by questioning whether scientific knowledge is, as Foucault suggests, ?linked in a circular relation with systems of power which produce and sustain it, and to effects of power which it induces and which extend it. A regime of truth; - relevant texts to this discussion are Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 and Darren Aronofsky's Pi."

How is the threat of child mortality treated in the New-England Primer's rhyming alphabet (1727) and Christina Rossetti's verse parable Goblin Market (1862)? How do Isaac Watts and George MacDonald respond differently to the challenge of introducing young readers to Christian theology? What taxonomic comparisons might we locate between John Newbery's eighteenth-century compendiums and Victorian children's magazine? This course will also develop students' skills in using archival databases such as Eighteenth-Centurey Collections Online and Nineteenth-Century Collections Online."

As a concept, we trace the theoretical understanding of the human from humanism, transhumanism to posthumanism. As a lived reality, we consider our place in the shifting relations between the human, the nonhuman and our environments.

1102,HH2015,BIOPOLITICS & EAST ASIAN HISTORY,3.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This course offers a comparative study of issues related to the history of biology and the uses of biological knowledge in East Asia. Biomedical technologies, biosecurity, biodiversity, and biobanking number among various issues that increasingly pertain to biopolitics. Used to describe 17th century shifts in sovereign power, Foucault raised the term biopolitics, along with anatomo-politics, to describe how different levels of life became increasingly regulated, from species-centric populations to individual bodies, respectively. Issues that involve the biological occur in many different locations with different styles of governance, but analyses of biopolitics have tended to relate more to European history. Within the grain of Asian history, the study of issues that involve the biological requires a questioning of existing theoretical frameworks used to examine the politicization of life. This class explores imperial, colonial, and national experiences in East Asia in order to examine how various societies, polities, and people have authored, approached, and interpreted knowledge about different levels of regenerative life. HH1001 highly recommended in preparation of this course."

1111,HH3032,SCIENCE & RELIGION IN HISTORY,3.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"Many people, including historians of science in earlier ages, believed that science and religion are contraries. Science is often considered the paradigm of humans' rational thoughts that fight against all kinds of ignorance, bigotry, and superstition, which may include religious thoughts and practices. However, many historians of science after the late twentieth century have found that the relationship between science and religion is far more complex. In some cases, religions do hamper and suppress some scientists' claims and activities, but religions can also be a positive factor in the construction of scientific ideas and worldviews, including those for the rise of modern science. This course aims at your deeper understanding of this complexity in a historical depth."

You will learn how different kinds of practice and theory became 'mainstream,' for whom, and in what time period, and in so doing, come to a broad synthetic understanding of Chinese medical culture. This will build to a reflection on the continuity and change in the modern biomedical context of Chinese medicine, and how medical heritage has become a site of cultural negotiation. The course will contain opportunity for hands-on experience of different traditional healing arts, as well as site-visits to different locations on and off campus."
1113,HH3045,COLD WAR IN ASIA: TRANSNATIONAL & MICRO APPROACHES,3.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This module explores the history of the Cold War in Asia, using a micro and transnational approach. Before the 2000s, most historical research on the Cold War was either American-centric or Euro-centric. The non-Western world, in particular East Asia, a `fault-line region' (Major and Mitter), was under-studied. The history of the Cold War therefore was asymmetrical. The end of the Cold War and the subsequent opening of archives in former colonies enable the reconstruction of Cold War history in East and Southeast Asia in a broad historical context connecting them with China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia). Adopting a micro and transnational approach, this course uses Hong Kong, a `Cold War pivot' as a starting point to trace how ideas were disseminated transborder and how big powers' activities in the colony affected how the Cold War was unfolded in countries in East and Southeast Asia. Ever since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Hong Kong, a British colony, was a battleground for competing ideologies: communism and capitalism. Hong Kong was relatively liberal as a colony. Economically, the principle of `laissez-faire' was adopted by the colonial regime. Politically, despite the absence of democracy, the colonial government introduced the City District Officer Scheme to solicit public opinion. Socially, the state propagated the idea of freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion. As an alien administration that ruled over two million Chinese residents in the post-war period, the colonial government constantly faced a problem of legitimacy and was susceptible to Communist infiltration. The Chinese Communist Party participated in Hong Kong life and used its base in the territory to encourage the uptake of radical ideas throughout Asia. In addition, the United States Information Services and the Nationalists disseminated propaganda to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia using its representative and secret operatives in Hong Kong. Hong Kong also played important role during conflicts. For example, through Hong Kong, strategic goods were shipped to Korea during the Korean War despite the trade embargo. And it was also a shelter for Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War. In theory, under British liberal legal traditions, the administration sought to create a permissive environment for social movements to propagate ideas that were critical of colonialism and capitalism. In practice, the colonial state monitored radicalism closely and repressed it using all possible means. The approach adopted by the colonial government in handling these Cold War activities influenced how the Cold War was unfolded in Asia, in particular Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and Singapore. Through this course, not only comparisons can be drawn between Cold War activities in different territories and countries, students can also learn about the transnational network: how ideas, ruling strategies and technologies flowed and exchanged transnationally and people moved across the borders. Both high diplomacy and cultural activities will be explored. Students can identify similarities and differences in Cold War experiences between the East and the West, setting up a transnational comparative framework for further studies."
1114,HH4007,INTERNATIONAL HISTORY OF THE COLD WAR,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HH1001 OR HH9101,,"This course is about the history of Southeast Asia and the Cold War. It aims to enlighten students on the origins and course of the conflict in the subregion in the global context. It also seeks to help students appreciate the cultural, diplomatic, economic, political, and social impacts of the twentieth century global conflict on Southeast Asia. In addition, the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history."

1117,HH4029,"HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA & COLONIAL HONG KONG, C.1945-1997",4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HH1001,,"This module explores the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of British Hong Kong during the period from 1945 to 1997. It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony. Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired."
1118,HH4030,PREHISTORY & ARCHAEOLOGY IN EAST & SOUTHEAST ASIA,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"The aim of the course is to provide students with a general overview of the basic themes and issues in the prehistory of archaeology in East and Southeast Asia. This course is designed to introduce students to the archaeologies of East Asia and Southeast Asia; the area stretching from the Japanese Archipelago in the East to the western borders of China in Central Asia. The course primarily focuses on the prehistoric period but also extends into the early historic period (~40,000 BC to 1000 AD). The course is designed to progress chronologically, but with particular emphasis placed on specific themes, among them: early human migrations and expansions, the origins and dispersal of food production, development and spread of metallurgy, interregional contacts and the rise of hierarchical social organizations and urbanism. We will also examine the practice of archaeology in East Asia and how modern political processes have influenced the inferences made about the past."
1119,HH4031,HISTORY & ARCHAEOLOGY OF ANCIENT CHINA,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This course will examine the ancient roots of Chinese civilization, from the fluid mix of regional cultures in the Neolithic period (beginning ca. 8000 B.C.E.) through the establishment of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.E.-220 C.E.). In addition to covering major political developments, we will pay close attention to religious, intellectual, and social trends, as well as to changes in the material culture of ancient China. Throughout the course we will focus particularly on recent archaeological discoveries. Nearly eighty years of scientific archaeology in China has produced a wide array of data that have revolutionized our understanding of ancient history. As new texts and artifacts continue to be unearthed, historians struggle to reconcile this new knowledge about the past with a received historical tradition that goes back 2000 years. This tension between received historical knowledge and modern archaeology puts archaeology at the heart of fierce historiographic debates. This course will explore these issues by examining early Chinese history in light of major archaeological discoveries of texts and materials, discussing both the content of the discoveries and their impact on the historiography of ancient China."

1121,HH4091,SPECIAL TOPICS IN HISTORY- INTERDISCIPLINARY HISTORY,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This course examines the important history of women and medicine in China by focusing on one of the most prominent areas: women's reproductive health. It discusses how a variety of actors conceptualized, discussed, constructed, or even contested Chinese women's reproductive health and bodies from the imperial period to the twentieth century. Employing a thematic rather than a chronological approach, this course covers a series of prominent themes related to women's reproduction, ranging from theorizations of the female reproductive body in classic works, to pragmatic and scientific practices in managing reproductive ailments such as menstruation, miscarriage, childbirth, and prenatal and postpartum care.

Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use."

1144,HG4071,THE MEAT OF SPEECH,4.0,LMS(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HG2003,,"The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical terminology, but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the physiological principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last. The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques. The mechanism of the supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory speech synthesizers (such as VocaiTractlab; http://www.vocaltractlab.de/) will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such as voicing and aspiration, will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal articulation. Students will gain an appreciation of the complex orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce detailed descriptions of the physiological events involved such sequences, including those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression. The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to some of the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain. The students will be introduced briefly to the anatomy of the brain and the cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production and perception by describing (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound. The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible. Key subjects covered include: 1. using anatomical and physiological terminology to describe the processes of speech production and perception; 2. the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms of speech production; 3. an appreciation of the link (and sometimes lack thereof) between anatomical form and physiological function; 4. an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing; 5. practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation data."

Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections.

We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity. For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning. We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs."

The first half of the course will address various types of migration and key transnational framings of the movements of people across domestic and international boundaries. In the second half, the ways in which various states deal with the diversity of their temporary and more permanent immigrant populations will be explored. This is done using a case study approach that allows for a deeper understanding of each site. Finally, the course introduces some elements of everyday migrant life in order to provide a balance to highly state-centric readings of migration. The course seeks to link issues of migration with understandings of contemporary multiculturalism so that they can be examined as interrelated transnational phenomena.
