The concept of business sustainability comprises three pillars: economic, environmental and social (Human & Labor) - also known as people, planet and profits. (Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp_). The focus recently (including by regulators) has added a fourth pillar - governance (anti-bribery and corruption). Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery & corruption, fraud, labor and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making. As sustainability, anti-corruption and corporate social responsibility (""CSR"") issues gain recognition as fundamental to strategy and execution in all organizations, this course will examine the measures we can take to ensure sustainability.

Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar. A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport. Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too. In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all.","Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology"

The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering. What sort of literary and other cultural responses were there in relation to the state's policies on culture and racial management in the 1980s?

It is not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to impinge upon the everyday lives of people. Called the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway), World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles.

The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century.

Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

The main reason is the emergence of the US-China strategic competition, particularly in Asia. With its increasing economic and military capabilities, China has challenged US primacy in the region, and to that end, China attempts to create its strategy vision and increase influence while the United States creates its own vision to counter it. In this context, many policy-makers and scholars in the United States and China provide the ideas for US or Chinese ""grand strategy"". These discussions over US and Chinese grand strategies are important because those ideas shape great powers' behavior that in turn determines the future direction of global and regional politics. However, the fundamental questions remain. There is little consensus over the concept of grand strategy, and each policy-makers and scholars use the term differently. Also, it is unclear whether superpowers or great powers are the only actors that monopolize ""grand strategy"" in the international relations. While great powers are important players in international politics, small and middle powers also have agency.

This course focuses on the examples found in premodern Asia. This course analyzes the myths and legends associated with heroes and heroines, and examines archaeological remains, such as statues, paintings, and temples linked to such individuals in conjunction with historical records. For the prehistoric period, archaeological remains provide important artifacts which can be used to hypothesize the importance and role of heroic beings, who would have been ancestor figures. As we get into the historical period, kings, queens, and other figures assumed important positions as heroic figures of authority who possessed spiritual powers. With the advent of world religions, for example, new archetypes were created, and new traits were qualities which members aim to emulate.

We also consider whether claims about the occurrence of miracles can furnish credible evidence for God's existence. Then we turn to an influential argument for atheism, and assess whether the existence of evil constitutes evidence against the God of monotheism. In the second part of the course, we inquire about the rationality of religious faith. Should we expect a rational justification for religious faith, or rather, is faith an attitude that shouldn't be subjected to rational scrutiny? Finally, in light of the fact that there are a multitude of religions that make incompatible claims to truth, we examine whether religions can be worthy of our adherence even if they some of their fundamental tenets are false.

In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation. This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly.

The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives. The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities. Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives.

HG4071,THE MEAT OF SPEECH,4,School of Humanities,Yes,Letter Graded,[['HG2003']],,"The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical terminology, but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the physiological principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last. The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques. The mechanism of the supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory speech synthesizers (such as VocaiTractlab; http://www.vocaltractlab.de/) will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such as voicing and aspiration, will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal articulation. Students will gain an appreciation of the complex orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce detailed descriptions of the physiological events involved such sequences, including those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression. The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to some of the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain. The students will be introduced briefly to the anatomy of the brain and the cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production and perception by describing (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound. The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract.

CS4316,STORYTELLING IN ADVERTISING,4,Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information,Yes,Letter Graded,,,"In order to sell a product, one must tell a story: one that engages the customer on a deeply emotional level. This is vital to modern branding, defining your company ethos and building long-term customer relationships. This course concentrates on visual storytelling for cinema, television and multi-media. Story depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles. Having instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.

Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis?

HH3032,SCIENCE & RELIGION IN HISTORY,3,School of Humanities,Yes,Letter Graded,,,"Many people, including historians of science in earlier ages, believed that science and religion are contraries. Science is often considered the paradigm of humans' rational thoughts that fight against all kinds of ignorance, bigotry, and superstition, which may include religious thoughts and practices. However, many historians of science after the late twentieth century have found that the relationship between science and religion is far more complex. In some cases, religions do hamper and suppress some scientists' claims and activities, but religions can also be a positive factor in the construction of scientific ideas and worldviews, including those for the rise of modern science. This course aims at your deeper understanding of this complexity in a historical depth.",History

HH3045,COLD WAR IN ASIA: TRANSNATIONAL & MICRO APPROACHES,3,School of Humanities,Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This module explores the history of the Cold War in Asia, using a micro and transnational approach. Before the 2000s, most historical research on the Cold War was either American-centric or Euro-centric. The non-Western world, in particular East Asia, a `fault-line region' (Major and Mitter), was under-studied. The history of the Cold War therefore was asymmetrical. The end of the Cold War and the subsequent opening of archives in former colonies enable the reconstruction of Cold War history in East and Southeast Asia in a broad historical context connecting them with China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia). Adopting a micro and transnational approach, this course uses Hong Kong, a `Cold War pivot' as a starting point to trace how ideas were disseminated transborder and how big powers' activities in the colony affected how the Cold War was unfolded in countries in East and Southeast Asia. Ever since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Hong Kong, a British colony, was a battleground for competing ideologies: communism and capitalism. Hong Kong was relatively liberal as a colony. Economically, the principle of `laissez-faire' was adopted by the colonial regime. Politically, despite the absence of democracy, the colonial government introduced the City District Officer Scheme to solicit public opinion. Socially, the state propagated the idea of freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion. As an alien administration that ruled over two million Chinese residents in the post-war period, the colonial government constantly faced a problem of legitimacy and was susceptible to Communist infiltration. The Chinese Communist Party participated in Hong Kong life and used its base in the territory to encourage the uptake of radical ideas throughout Asia. In addition, the United States Information Services and the Nationalists disseminated propaganda to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia using its representative and secret operatives in Hong Kong. Hong Kong also played important role during conflicts. For example, through Hong Kong, strategic goods were shipped to Korea during the Korean War despite the trade embargo. And it was also a shelter for Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War. In theory, under British liberal legal traditions, the administration sought to create a permissive environment for social movements to propagate ideas that were critical of colonialism and capitalism. In practice, the colonial state monitored radicalism closely and repressed it using all possible means. The approach adopted by the colonial government in handling these Cold War activities influenced how the Cold War was unfolded in Asia, in particular Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and Singapore. Through this course, not only comparisons can be drawn between Cold War activities in different territories and countries, students can also learn about the transnational network: how ideas, ruling strategies and technologies flowed and exchanged transnationally and people moved across the borders. Both high diplomacy and cultural activities will be explored. Students can identify similarities and differences in Cold War experiences between the East and the West, setting up a transnational comparative framework for further studies.",History
HH4007,INTERNATIONAL HISTORY OF THE COLD WAR,4,School of Humanities,Yes,Letter Graded,[['HH1001']],,"This course is about the history of Southeast Asia and the Cold War. It aims to enlighten students on the origins and course of the conflict in the subregion in the global context. It also seeks to help students appreciate the cultural, diplomatic, economic, political, and social impacts of the twentieth century global conflict on Southeast Asia. In addition, the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history.",History

It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony. Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired.",History

This course is designed to introduce students to the archaeologies of East Asia and Southeast Asia; the area stretching from the Japanese Archipelago in the East to the western borders of China in Central Asia. The course primarily focuses on the prehistoric period but also extends into the early historic period (~40,000 BC to 1000 AD). The course is designed to progress chronologically, but with particular emphasis placed on specific themes, among them: early human migrations and expansions, the origins and dispersal of food production, development and spread of metallurgy, interregional contacts and the rise of hierarchical social organizations and urbanism.

HH4031,HISTORY & ARCHAEOLOGY OF ANCIENT CHINA,4,School of Humanities,Yes,Letter Graded,,,"This course will examine the ancient roots of Chinese civilization, from the fluid mix of regional cultures in the Neolithic period (beginning ca. 8000 B.C.E.) through the establishment of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.E.-220 C.E.). In addition to covering major political developments, we will pay close attention to religious, intellectual, and social trends, as well as to changes in the material culture of ancient China. Throughout the course we will focus particularly on recent archaeological discoveries. Nearly eighty years of scientific archaeology in China has produced a wide array of data that have revolutionized our understanding of ancient history. As new texts and artifacts continue to be unearthed, historians struggle to reconcile this new knowledge about the past with a received historical tradition that goes back 2000 years. This tension between received historical knowledge and modern archaeology puts archaeology at the heart of fierce historiographic debates. This course will explore these issues by examining early Chinese history in light of major archaeological discoveries of texts and materials, discussing both the content of the discoveries and their impact on the historiography of ancient China.",History

Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time?
