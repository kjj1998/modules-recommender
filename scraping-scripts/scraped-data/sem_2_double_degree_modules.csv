Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts.

Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis?

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis?

Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis?

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include: 1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains? 2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now. 3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization. All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."
