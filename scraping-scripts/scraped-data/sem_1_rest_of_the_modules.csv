10,HL3001,FILM THEORY,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001(Corequisite) OR FL8001 (Min Grade :B),AAR23C,"Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module.

12,HL3043,MODERNIST SOUNDSCAPES,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"While the Western world may not have gotten noisier in the early twentieth century, there is evidence that people perceived the world as noisier. Emily Thompson explains that in the Victorian period the 'sounds that so bothered Carlyle and Goethe were almost identical to those that had been identified by the Buddha centuries earlier: organic sounds created by humans and animals at work and at play' (Soundscape 116). It is not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to impinge upon the everyday lives of people. Called the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway), World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles.

14,HL4024,ADVANCED STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This module seeks to investigate various fictional images of the contemporary world. The contemporary, as it appears in the novels on this course, is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes. These authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery in society and are keenly aware of the multi-racial/religious natures of their cities and towns. Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel. Thus, it is possible to consider their work as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain."

16,HH4005,CULTURE AND HERITAGE: PERSPECTIVES FROM HISTORY,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"The course will address issues which pertain to the debates and discussions of culture and heritage. One of the most neglected resources in any society is the intangible aspects of its cultural and historical heritage. Some countries and regions within countries have been quite successful in marketing certain segments of their cultural and historical heritage. One of the most successful examples in Southeast Asia is Bali, which manages to promote both older and more recently created cultural practices and performances as -traditions-. Today Bali can still be considered a living heritage site in the sense that the Balinese continue their daily ritual practices and routines. However the authenticity of some of the art forms and performances can be questioned. Though this course will address theoretical issues and examples from various places in the world, class discussions and case studies will come predominantly from Asian examples. Some questions to be addressed include the following: what can be considered cultural and historical heritage in each society? Can these be divided into categories such as good and bad, marketable and non-marketable, representative and non-representative, etc? How does a person use heritage tourism as a means of preserving cultural and historical heritage of people who are gradually -losing- their pasts?"

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at the end of the course."

While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature'from deconstruction to queer theory' might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works.

These inward explorations coincided with a series of political, cultural, and philosophical debates that reconfigured public life and continue to shape our modern sensibilities. Taking taxonomy as an overall theme, this course begins by delineating approaches to perception, articulation, and emotion that emerged during the long eighteenth century. Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children's books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material.

The central context of the dramatic changes lie in changes in modernization policy in Singapore - in the 1970s, from a 'pragmatic' and culturally philistine modernization that sought to homogenize/standardize culture and the cityscape in the name of economic development, to a 1990s- present modernization that (in contrast) desires Singapore to be a more hip 'global city for the arts' (a 1992 government-policy phrase). The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering. What sort of literary and other cultural responses were there in relation to the state's policies on culture and racial management in the 1980s? What happened in the state's thinking on culture in the 1990s that led a (supposed move away from a philistinism) to a desire to invest in the arts? How did creative-cultural producers relate to these unexpected changes? Such will be the questions that this module will address."

In this, it also seeks to map the genre's most defining topoi: travel through space, time, and parallel universes; experimental technology; alien life; testing the boundaries of the mind and manipulating the body (cloning). Science fiction has always been experimental in its technique as well as in its critique of social, psychological, and scientific definitions of selfhood, and its study taps into encompassing explorations of epistemological as well as ontological anxieties."

The comparison of canonical Victorian works and only recently reprinted material, primarily by long forgotten nineteenth-century women writers, will help us to understand the literary developments that engendered a plethora of controversies, both at the time and in its wake, brought out such a versatility of works, and perhaps above all, created the novel genre as the Victorian era's most popular, critical, and representative form of cultural expression."

183,HL4024,ADVANCED STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This module seeks to investigate various fictional images of the contemporary world. The contemporary, as it appears in the novels on this course, is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes. These authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery in society and are keenly aware of the multi-racial/religious natures of their cities and towns. Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel. Thus, it is possible to consider their work as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain."

185,HL4036,LITERATURE & MEDICINE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001 OR HJ5001,,"Literature and Medicine seeks to present health as a contested term with a continually evolving set of principles and meanings. The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century. Sociological readings on the history and philosophy of medicine that signal the inadequa-cy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically and geographically sit-uated. Novels concerned with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our understanding of health and sickness. Material from the emergent field of the medical humanities including anthropology and cultural studies, literature and applied linguistics, performing arts, visual art, and creative practices with a focus on healing and recovery. Supplementary material on approaches to delivering humanities into healthcare and the requirement for practice based evidence."
186,HL4038,ADVANCED STUDIES IN POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"HL4038 Advanced Studies in Postcolonial Literature highlights the challenges faced by writers from the global south, namely domestication/exoticism which denies and subverts alterity. Such concerns are linked to the increasingly popular sub-geme, ""postcolonial gothic"", which is read as an ambivalent means to circumvent commodification. Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging. Texts may include Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger (2008), Raja Rao's Kanthapura (1938/1970), Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, and Beth Yahp's The Crocodile Sea."

The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at the end of the course."

269,HG2094,WORD OF MOUTH: TRANSMISSION OF ORAL CULTURE,3.0,LMS(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"The course introduces fundamental topics in Orality in Linguistics and Oral Culture and Literature. It would consist of a basic introduction to linguistic strategies in the transmission of traditional knowledge in preliterate cultures all over the world, from Antiquity (Homer and the Homeric poems), to the Middle Ages (the Irish Filid, the original Old Norse poetry), to our times (the Serbian Guslari, the studies on orality by Marcel Jousse), plus a specific focus on indigenous cultures in Australia and Africa, and in South-East Asia. The course will provide the students with a general and accurate overview of the above-mentioned topics, associating notions of Language Documentation and Language Description with elements of Anthropological Linguistics, Philology, and Comparative Literature. The course examines the epistemological issue of orality, culture, and literacy both from the point of view of basic original and theoretical principles established by the best scholars in this discipline (from Milman Parry, to Albert Lord, to Eric Havelock, to Marcel Jousse, to John Foley, to Ruth Finnegan, to Edgard Sienaert), and from the point of view of the direct analysis of examples of oral `unwritten texts? and oral strategies in handing down the traditional knowledge. The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of Theoretical Linguistics and Comparative Literature. Particular attention will be given to the analysis of a number of methodological `milestones? in the study on orality, culture, and literacy, in particular to The Anthropology of Gesture by Marcel Jousse and to works by Milman Parry, Eric Havelock, Albert Lord, and Ruth Finnegan.

Comparison of different character types and human beings' divergent perceptions of heroes and heroines shaped the histories we write of the roles of individuals and communities in the world. This course focuses on the examples found in premodern Asia. This course analyzes the myths and legends associated with heroes and heroines, and examines archaeological remains, such as statues, paintings, and temples linked to such individuals in conjunction with historical records. For the prehistoric period, archaeological remains provide important artifacts which can be used to hypothesize the importance and role of heroic beings, who would have been ancestor figures. As we get into the historical period, kings, queens, and other figures assumed important positions as heroic figures of authority who possessed spiritual powers. With the advent of world religions, for example, new archetypes were created, and new traits were qualities which members aim to emulate. This course examines the evolution of the ideal individual (hero and heroine) in premodern Asia. It considers whether continuity or change was more characteristic of the direction in which the heroic figure developed across time and region."

283,HH4005,CULTURE AND HERITAGE: PERSPECTIVES FROM HISTORY,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"The course will address issues which pertain to the debates and discussions of culture and heritage. One of the most neglected resources in any society is the intangible aspects of its cultural and historical heritage. Some countries and regions within countries have been quite successful in marketing certain segments of their cultural and historical heritage. One of the most successful examples in Southeast Asia is Bali, which manages to promote both older and more recently created cultural practices and performances as -traditions-. Today Bali can still be considered a living heritage site in the sense that the Balinese continue their daily ritual practices and routines. However the authenticity of some of the art forms and performances can be questioned. Though this course will address theoretical issues and examples from various places in the world, class discussions and case studies will come predominantly from Asian examples. Some questions to be addressed include the following: what can be considered cultural and historical heritage in each society? Can these be divided into categories such as good and bad, marketable and non-marketable, representative and non-representative, etc? How does a person use heritage tourism as a means of preserving cultural and historical heritage of people who are gradually -losing- their pasts?"

The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change.

We also consider whether claims about the occurrence of miracles can furnish credible evidence for God's existence. Then we turn to an influential argument for atheism, and assess whether the existence of evil constitutes evidence against the God of monotheism. In the second part of the course, we inquire about the rationality of religious faith. Should we expect a rational justification for religious faith, or rather, is faith an attitude that shouldn't be subjected to rational scrutiny? Finally, in light of the fact that there are a multitude of religions that make incompatible claims to truth, we examine whether religions can be worthy of our adherence even if they some of their fundamental tenets are false. The course will conclude with a reflection on the important roles that religion can play in people's lives, apart from being a source of truth-claims."

Although this approach may be intuitive due to its physical setup, it tends to give the wrong impression that wave functions are fundamental objects in QM. In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation. This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly. You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. Part 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems.

494,HA4042,GRAND STRATEGY: FROM GREAT POWERS TO SMALL POWERS IN ASIA,2.0,PPGA(SSS),Yes,Letter Graded,HA1001,,"""Grand Strategy"" has become a buzzword for International Relations since the 21st Century. The main reason is the emergence of the US-China strategic competition, particularly in Asia. With its increasing economic and military capabilities, China has challenged US primacy in the region, and to that end, China attempts to create its strategy vision and increase influence while the United States creates its own vision to counter it. In this context, many policy-makers and scholars in the United States and China provide the ideas for US or Chinese ""grand strategy"". These discussions over US and Chinese grand strategies are important because those ideas shape great powers' behavior that in turn determines the future direction of global and regional politics. However, the fundamental questions remain. There is little consensus over the concept of grand strategy, and each policy-makers and scholars use the term differently. Also, it is unclear whether superpowers or great powers are the only actors that monopolize ""grand strategy"" in the international relations. While great powers are important players in international politics, small and middle powers also have agency. In this context, this course explores the concept of grand strategy and a broad range of grand strategies formulated by great, middle, and small powers that affect regional politics by using the case of Asian states."

The concept of business sustainability comprises three pillars: economic, environmental and social (Human & Labor) - also known as people, planet and profits. (Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp_). The focus recently (including by regulators) has added a fourth pillar - governance (anti-bribery and corruption). Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery & corruption, fraud, labor and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making. As sustainability, anti-corruption and corporate social responsibility (""CSR"") issues gain recognition as fundamental to strategy and execution in all organizations, this course will examine the measures we can take to ensure sustainability. Initiatives & laws such as Anti-Bribery and Corruption (e.g., the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act), the Sustainable Development Goals, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact will be considered, along with practical examples of implementation or lack thereof. The focus will be on best practices in addressing sustainability/CSR challenges and opportunities faced by all entities/organizations. Entities that incorporate sustainability practices into their operations benefit directly and indirectly, including but not limited to, productivity gains, improved image and enhanced reputation, and attraction and retention of human capital. We will discuss some international and local laws that are relevant to doing business in Singapore, Asia and globally.

Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.

Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery & corruption, fraud, labor and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making. As sustainability, anti-corruption and corporate social responsibility (""CSR"") issues gain recognition as fundamental to strategy and execution in all organizations, this course will examine the measures we can take to ensure sustainability. Initiatives & laws such as Anti-Bribery and Corruption (e.g., the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act), the Sustainable Development Goals, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact will be considered, along with practical examples of implementation or lack thereof. The focus will be on best practices in addressing sustainability/CSR challenges and opportunities faced by all entities/organizations.

Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general."

A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport. Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too. In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

You should take this course, first, if you would like to learn why we study Genomes and Genomics, and why the field has been exponentially grown since the human genome project completed in 2010. Genomics and sequencing technology have driven various fields of science and significantly affected human life. Second, you should take this course if you would like to learn what is genetic differences between individuals and how it expresses as traits, disease symptoms, and responses to pathogens. Besides, you will learn about how Genomics can contribute to the identification and treatment of diseases by analyzing personal genomes. If you are interested in your future careers in public health, life science, medicine, insurance, risk assessment, and big data, this course should be helpful. You will learn how the technology of genome sequencing, has affected human social structure or system, for instance, marriage and pregnancy by obtaining person genome information. You will think about your identity by disclosing your genetic ancestry and how it affects society and politics sometimes. You will learn the current trend of that government actively generate population genome data along with medical records from their citizen. This is closely related to developing public health policy, medical facility, and system, insurance policy, storing and analyzing of the big data, which all effects economics. Ultimately, the accumulation of genome data will impact your life, especially for your lifetime health. By the end of this course, you will obtain knowledge and your own value on life technology, which something you cannot learn from textbooks. In addition, you should be able to predict how humans will evolve in near future in terms of genetics and society. The human genome will evolve in a unique way, not only under nature?s law but also by technology which can change genes or reduce risks. This can be essential knowledge for everyone during this pandemic. The course will have also shed a light on Asian populations which have been relatively understudied. You can learn about Asian population genomics directly from scientists who are currently conducting research for Asians."

We will focus primarily on the relationship between 'form' and 'history' in seeking to understand this literature, where 'form' refers to a given text's genre or mode (e.g., 'revenge tragedy'), its linguistic and narrative characteristics, and so on, while 'history' means both material and cultural formations as these change through time. While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature'from deconstruction to queer theory' might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works. The course will touch upon a number of 'big' themes in English literature, with particular emphasis on the rise of individualism and the impact of the Reformation on early-modern culture and thought."

1074,HL2004,SENSIBILITY & ROMANTICISM,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"The Age of Sensibility and Romanticism witnessed a surge of interest in emotional responsiveness, imagination, and individual subjectivity. These inward explorations coincided with a series of political, cultural, and philosophical debates that reconfigured public life and continue to shape our modern sensibilities. Taking taxonomy as an overall theme, this course begins by delineating approaches to perception, articulation, and emotion that emerged during the long eighteenth century. Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children's books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material. Literary works, such as poetry and fiction, will be examined alongside pedagogical theory and discourses on elocution and aesthetics. Throughout the course, we will consider our own experience as readers of eighteenth-century and Romantic texts in relation to reading practice during the period. How did rising literacy rates and innovations in textual production and circulation influence literary form, genre, and taste?"
1075,HL2008,SINGAPORE LITERATURE & CULTURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This module examines select literary and dramatic/theatre works in the light of the changes in Singapore literature and culture since independence in 1965 to the present, with an emphasis on the 1980s to the 2000s. The central context of the dramatic changes lie in changes in modernization policy in Singapore - in the 1970s, from a 'pragmatic' and culturally philistine modernization that sought to homogenize/standardize culture and the cityscape in the name of economic development, to a 1990s- present modernization that (in contrast) desires Singapore to be a more hip 'global city for the arts' (a 1992 government-policy phrase). The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering. What sort of literary and other cultural responses were there in relation to the state's policies on culture and racial management in the 1980s? What happened in the state's thinking on culture in the 1990s that led a (supposed move away from a philistinism) to a desire to invest in the arts? How did creative-cultural producers relate to these unexpected changes? Such will be the questions that this module will address."

Whatconstitutes ""America"" before 1789? Are these texts ""literary""? Does our study of these texts require a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only English language texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these 'secondary' histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?"

In addition to the predominantly nineteenth-, twentieth- and twenty-first century texts themselves, the course will explore the modern fantasy genre as a product of histories of ideas stretching from centuries past to the present day. With a syllabus spanning from medievalism to modernity via magic, the course welcomes all students interested in exploring the broad genre of fantasy, and the imaginative processes and ideological traditions thereof. In addition to exploring the farthest reaches of the literary imagination, you will also gain - paradoxical though it may seem - an understanding of how these authors and texts negotiate universal themes relating to the realities of human existence, including myth-making, modernisation and the environment."

When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory.

In this, it also seeks to map the genre's most defining topoi: travel through space, time, and parallel universes; experimental technology; alien life; testing the boundaries of the mind and manipulating the body (cloning). Science fiction has always been experimental in its technique as well as in its critique of social, psychological, and scientific definitions of selfhood, and its study taps into encompassing explorations of epistemological as well as ontological anxieties."
1086,HL3014,LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This module explores a diverse range of Latin American literatures - including works from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address.

1089,HL3043,MODERNIST SOUNDSCAPES,3.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"While the Western world may not have gotten noisier in the early twentieth century, there is evidence that people perceived the world as noisier. Emily Thompson explains that in the Victorian period the 'sounds that so bothered Carlyle and Goethe were almost identical to those that had been identified by the Buddha centuries earlier: organic sounds created by humans and animals at work and at play' (Soundscape 116). It is not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to impinge upon the everyday lives of people. Called the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway), World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles. This course explores how modernist writers represented this soundscape. How did they make their narratives sound out? How did the changing soundscape influence and shape their representations of sound and listening?"

This course examines a central theme or question in the field of medieval literature through a selection of literary works, both canonical and non-canonical. In order to understand these works within their historical context we will also explore other approaches to the course's focal theme, reading historical and theological works and analysing manuscripts and works of visual art. You will be expected to draw on these approaches in your final research paper."
1093,HL4019,ADVANCED STUDIES IN VICTORIAN LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This course allows students to take a more focused approach to Victorian literature and culture. By providing a thematic, rather than a chronological, introduction to a number of nineteenth-century literary texts, it aims to show that the shifts in literary representations at the time were part of an extremely versatile cultural scene that belies any retrospective typecasting of ""Victorianism."" The comparison of canonical Victorian works and only recently reprinted material, primarily by long forgotten nineteenth-century women writers, will help us to understand the literary developments that engendered a plethora of controversies, both at the time and in its wake, brought out such a versatility of works, and perhaps above all, created the novel genre as the Victorian era's most popular, critical, and representative form of cultural expression."
1094,HL4020,ADVANCED STUDIES IN MODERNIST LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This course looks at the aesthetics of modernism in relation to turn-of-the-century technological advances that changed auditory and visual perception. In particular, we will think about how mechanical reproduction, which was integral to photography, film, and the phonograph, influenced modernist writers. By closely examining the novels of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Alfred Doblin and John Dos Passos, we will question how modernist writers made use of perception-enhancing technologies both thematically and formally in their writing."
1095,HL4023,ADVANCED STUDIES IN AMERICAN LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001(Corequisite),,"This course deepens understanding of American literature by engaging with challenging works of fiction and poetry that experiment with form and also engage with the nation's history, in order to produce a critical perspective of the twentieth century, especially in terms of how industrialization and modernization have led a to crisis in subjectivity that demands a revised understanding of ontology and moral foundations."
1096,HL4024,ADVANCED STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001,,"This module seeks to investigate various fictional images of the contemporary world. The contemporary, as it appears in the novels on this course, is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes. These authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery in society and are keenly aware of the multi-racial/religious natures of their cities and towns. Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel. Thus, it is possible to consider their work as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain."

1098,HL4036,LITERATURE & MEDICINE,4.0,ELH(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,HL1001 OR HJ5001,,"Literature and Medicine seeks to present health as a contested term with a continually evolving set of principles and meanings. The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century. Sociological readings on the history and philosophy of medicine that signal the inadequa-cy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically and geographically sit-uated. Novels concerned with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our understanding of health and sickness. Material from the emergent field of the medical humanities including anthropology and cultural studies, literature and applied linguistics, performing arts, visual art, and creative practices with a focus on healing and recovery.

Such concerns are linked to the increasingly popular sub-geme, ""postcolonial gothic"", which is read as an ambivalent means to circumvent commodification. Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging. Texts may include Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger (2008), Raja Rao's Kanthapura (1938/1970), Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, and Beth Yahp's The Crocodile Sea."

Through close reading of literary and visual narratives, you will consider how representations of dissidence, deviance and madness are employed to critique aspects of society and challenge the audience member or reader's habitual framework of understanding. The module core material will be considered within the contexts of existing constructs of reality, such as the representation of gender, societal expectations and sexual transgressions."

1116,HH2126,HEROES & HEROINES IN ASIA,3.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"Heroes and Heroines in Asia utilizes an approach of comparing historical and literary human archetypes to describe and discuss human perceptions of the ideal being, the heroic female and male. Comparison of different character types and human beings' divergent perceptions of heroes and heroines shaped the histories we write of the roles of individuals and communities in the world. This course focuses on the examples found in premodern Asia. This course analyzes the myths and legends associated with heroes and heroines, and examines archaeological remains, such as statues, paintings, and temples linked to such individuals in conjunction with historical records. For the prehistoric period, archaeological remains provide important artifacts which can be used to hypothesize the importance and role of heroic beings, who would have been ancestor figures. As we get into the historical period, kings, queens, and other figures assumed important positions as heroic figures of authority who possessed spiritual powers. With the advent of world religions, for example, new archetypes were created, and new traits were qualities which members aim to emulate. This course examines the evolution of the ideal individual (hero and heroine) in premodern Asia. It considers whether continuity or change was more characteristic of the direction in which the heroic figure developed across time and region."

1120,HH4005,CULTURE AND HERITAGE: PERSPECTIVES FROM HISTORY,4.0,HIST(SOH),Yes,Letter Graded,,,"The course will address issues which pertain to the debates and discussions of culture and heritage. One of the most neglected resources in any society is the intangible aspects of its cultural and historical heritage. Some countries and regions within countries have been quite successful in marketing certain segments of their cultural and historical heritage. One of the most successful examples in Southeast Asia is Bali, which manages to promote both older and more recently created cultural practices and performances as -traditions-. Today Bali can still be considered a living heritage site in the sense that the Balinese continue their daily ritual practices and routines. However the authenticity of some of the art forms and performances can be questioned. Though this course will address theoretical issues and examples from various places in the world, class discussions and case studies will come predominantly from Asian examples. Some questions to be addressed include the following: what can be considered cultural and historical heritage in each society? Can these be divided into categories such as good and bad, marketable and non-marketable, representative and non-representative, etc? How does a person use heritage tourism as a means of preserving cultural and historical heritage of people who are gradually -losing- their pasts?"

The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at the end of the course."

In the second part of the course, we inquire about the rationality of religious faith. Should we expect a rational justification for religious faith, or rather, is faith an attitude that shouldn't be subjected to rational scrutiny? Finally, in light of the fact that there are a multitude of religions that make incompatible claims to truth, we examine whether religions can be worthy of our adherence even if they some of their fundamental tenets are false.

Although this approach may be intuitive due to its physical setup, it tends to give the wrong impression that wave functions are fundamental objects in QM. In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation. This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly. You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. Part 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. The concept of measurement will also be covered. This provides probabilistic results for experiments. Part 2 aims to discuss symmetry within QM. Rotational symmetry (angular momentum is the generator of rotations) is the main and very important example. The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM. Part 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly. These are real-life QM examples and the standard method to solve these systems is via perturbation for time-independent/dependent and non-degenerate/degenerate systems."

1340,HA4042,GRAND STRATEGY: FROM GREAT POWERS TO SMALL POWERS IN ASIA,2.0,PPGA(SSS),Yes,Letter Graded,HA1001,,"""Grand Strategy"" has become a buzzword for International Relations since the 21st Century. The main reason is the emergence of the US-China strategic competition, particularly in Asia. With its increasing economic and military capabilities, China has challenged US primacy in the region, and to that end, China attempts to create its strategy vision and increase influence while the United States creates its own vision to counter it. In this context, many policy-makers and scholars in the United States and China provide the ideas for US or Chinese ""grand strategy"". These discussions over US and Chinese grand strategies are important because those ideas shape great powers' behavior that in turn determines the future direction of global and regional politics. However, the fundamental questions remain. There is little consensus over the concept of grand strategy, and each policy-makers and scholars use the term differently. Also, it is unclear whether superpowers or great powers are the only actors that monopolize ""grand strategy"" in the international relations. While great powers are important players in international politics, small and middle powers also have agency. In this context, this course explores the concept of grand strategy and a broad range of grand strategies formulated by great, middle, and small powers that affect regional politics by using the case of Asian states."
