Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts.

GC0001(Corequisite),"AB0001, AB0301, AB0401, AB0402, AB0501, AB0603","With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general."

As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

As sustainability, anti-corruption and corporate social responsibility (""CSR"") issues gain recognition as fundamental to strategy and execution in all organizations, this course will examine the measures we can take to ensure sustainability.

As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module. People with a background in the economics of mental health and well-being have found jobs working for the government and NGOs, creating a start-up company that caters directly to improving their clients? well-being, and working in academia."

As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

This will also give the students a valuable opportunity to interact personally with food industries and have a deeper understanding of the food policies and issues around the world. This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar. A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport. Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar. A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport. Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too. In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too. In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background. On the other hand, it will give everyone a chance to appreciate microeconomics in action right from the start of their education at NTU - a feature that is surprisingly amiss in many Economics undergraduate programs worldwide."

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

A course in the theory of mechanisms is essential for any mechanical engineers as the knowledge is fundamental in understanding the working of machines. Apart from analytical ability, it also provides students the opportunities to develop their design capability."

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life. According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing. The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education."

What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth?

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives.

What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth?

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background.

What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age?

In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does? This module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design. Other topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings. Students who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module.
